    This is the system I propose as a workable alternative to J0-naive.yml
rules:
    "F→":
        if:
            - "[F] A → B"
        then:

    "T→":
        if:
            - "[T] A -> B"
        then:
            - ["[F] A"]
            - ["[T] B"]
    "F+":
        if:
            - "[F] T+S:A"
        then:

    "F·":
