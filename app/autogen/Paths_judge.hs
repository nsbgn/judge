-- Normally, this file is generated by stack or cabal and the path is hardcoded 
-- into the binary, based on where the `data-files` in the .cabal package were 
-- installed. When creating a .deb or other kind of binary package, this 
-- should probably be more portable and point to /usr/share/judge or similar
